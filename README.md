# flutter-learning
1. plant_app is a shopping app I created to learn UI design in flutter.
2. http_req is the app that I created for http requests (GET AND POST) and also for storing data to local storage and secure storage.
3. secure_storage is a sample code that I pulled from an online repository and studying it currently to resolve some issues I am facing in my own code for storing and fetching from secure storage.
4. Other apps in the folder like test, todo_app and tourismandco are my own projects that I am working on to understand flutter better.

#Folder-structure
I have used standard flutter folder structure in all of my projects which is as follows: all of my code is stored inside the lib folder which includes subfolders like screens, assets, constants, models, services, etc.
